## Introduction
In 2023, the Kenyan government enacted the Social Health Insurance Act, aiming to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). This initiative strives to ensure that all citizens have access to quality healthcare services without incurring catastrophic health expenses. However, predicting the appropriate contributions for informal sector workers remains a challenge due to their variable incomes. Developing an accurate income prediction model can enhance the SHIF program by ensuring fair contributions, identifying low-income households for targeted social programs, and supporting the most vulnerable.

The curve plots the True Positive Rate (sensitivity) against the False Positive Rate (1-specificity) for each classifier. From the ROC curve, it is evident that all classifiers except Naive Bayes achieve perfect performance with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 1.00. This indicates flawless discrimination between classes for KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression models. The Naive Bayes classifier, while still performing well, has a slightly lower AUC of 0.96, indicating some degree of misclassification compared to the other models. The near-perfect and identical ROC curves for KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and Logistic Regression suggest these models are exceptionally effective for this classification task, reflecting their high accuracy and reliability. The Naive Bayes classifier, although slightly less accurate, still demonstrates strong performance, making it a viable option depending on the specific context and requirements of the task.

**Best Model (K-Nearest Neighbors)**

Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The confusion matrices provide a visual representation of model performance.
The bar graph indicate that the Random forest model show outstanding performance. The model achieved perfect classification across all classes, resulting in an overall accuracy of 99 percent.
